{{--
    The generated report preview.

    Rendered as a fragment by RecordReportController@generate and injected by the
    builder, so the figures on screen and the rows behind Download CSV come from
    the same filter builder and cannot disagree.

    The management comments box is saved with the output when the report is
    presented or downloaded, so the observations written here travel with the
    report they were written for. Nothing written here is an official output
    until one of the controls below is used.
