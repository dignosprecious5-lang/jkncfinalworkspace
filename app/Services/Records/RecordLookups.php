/**
 * Shared read-only lookups for the classification and index scheme.
 *
 * Both the intake queue and the master register offer the same Classification to
 * Index relationship, so the queries live here rather than being repeated per controller.
 *
 * Results are cached per tenant and company. These are small reference tables that
 * the scheme seeds rather than the interface edits, and every register, queue and
 * drawer page load reads all four of them, so caching removes a fixed cost from
 * every page. Each lookup keeps its own cache entry and its own SQL ordering: the
 * flat index list is sorted by code while the grouped one is sorted by sort order,
 * and merging them into a single entry would silently reorder one of the two.
 *
 * Only raw attribute rows are cached and the models are rebuilt from them, so no
 * hydrated model ever leaves this class and a cached entry can never hold a value
 * belonging to another company.
