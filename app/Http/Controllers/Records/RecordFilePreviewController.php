/**
 * Preview one specific stored file.
 *
 * The record and intake routes above address a preview by their owner, which is
 * only ever the current master. That is the right default for a pane, but it left
 * a record's supporting files and versions unopenable: every file in the payload
 * carried the same URL, because the URL described the record rather than the
 * file. This route names the file.
 *
 * One route parameter, and it is a string rather than a model. Laravel resolves
 * only class-typed parameters by name; anything else arrives positionally in
 * route order, so a two-parameter action here would hand this method the wrong
 * value. The arity matters — the file routes beside it were collapsed for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * Scope is the company, not the record: a file belongs to one or the other, and
 * both are only ever read inside the tenant and company the session is in.
